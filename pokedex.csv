There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun’s rays,
the seed grows progressively larger."
1,2,Ivysaur,"There is a bud on this Pokémon’s back. To support its weight,
Ivysaur’s legs and trunk grow thick and strong.
If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight,
it’s a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon."
2,3,Venusaur,"There is a large flower on Venusaur’s back. The flower is said
to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.
The flower’s aroma soothes the emotions of people."
3,4,Charmander,"The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication
of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander
is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged,
the flame burns fiercely."
4,5,Charmeleon,"Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp
claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive.
In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with
a bluish white color."
5,6,Charizard,"Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents.
It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.
However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent
weaker than itself."
6,7,Squirtle,"Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection.
The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its
surface help minimize resistance in water,
enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds."
7,8,Wartortle,"Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail
becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages.
The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s
toughness as a battler."
8,9,Blastoise,"Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell.
The water spouts are very accurate.
They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy
to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet."
9,10,Caterpie,"Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves
bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna,
this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor."
10,11,Metapod,"The shell covering this Pokémon’s body is as hard as an
iron slab. Metapod does not move very much.
It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for
evolution inside the hard shell."
11,12,Butterfree,"Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey
from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey
from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest."
12,13,Weedle,"Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable
of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it
dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."
13,14,Kakuna,"Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree.
However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares
for its coming evolution.
This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch."
14,15,Beedrill,"Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach
its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack
in a furious swarm."
15,16,Pidgey,"Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction.
It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest,
however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."
16,17,Pidgeotto,"Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This
Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory
is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe
with its sharp claws."
17,18,Pidgeot,"This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully
glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the
striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling
them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon."
18,19,Rattata,"Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep,
it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not
picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere."
19,20,Raticate,"Raticate’s sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them
ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may
even chew on the walls of houses."
20,21,Spearow,"Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over
half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all
around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."
21,22,Fearow,"Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak.
They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or
water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey."
22,23,Ekans,"Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this
position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any
direction with a glare from its upraised head."
23,24,Arbok,"This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things
with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok
wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crunching embrace
is impossible."
24,25,Pikachu,"This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks.
These appear to become electrically charged during the night
while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity
when it is dozy after waking up."
25,26,Raichu,"This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over
its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness.
Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity."
26,27,Sandshrew,"Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough.
The Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack.
At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep."
27,28,Sandslash,"Sandslash can roll up its body as if it were a ball covered
with large spikes. In battle, this Pokémon will try to make
the foe flinch by jabbing it with its spines. It then leaps at
the stunned foe to tear wildly with its sharp claws."
28,29,Nidoran♀,"Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison.
They are thought to have developed as protection for
this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases
a horrible toxin from its horn."
29,30,Nidorina,"When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep
their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other.
This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated
from the others."
30,31,Nidoqueen,"Nidoqueen’s body is encased in extremely hard scales.
It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This
Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."
31,32,Nidoran♂,"Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks
to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even
the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice."
32,33,Nidorino,"Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses
a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once,
and it challenges the foe with all its might."
33,34,Nidoking,"Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power.
With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once
this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it."
34,35,Clefairy,"On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon
come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy
return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep
nestled up against each other."
35,36,Clefable,"Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using
its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water.
It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights."
36,37,Vulpix,"Inside Vulpix’s body burns a flame that never goes out.
During the daytime, when the temperatures rise, this
Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to prevent its
body from growing too hot."
37,38,Ninetales,"Legend has it that Ninetales came into being when
nine wizards possessing sacred powers merged into one.
This Pokémon is highly intelligent—it can understand
human speech."
38,39,Jigglypuff,"When this Pokémon sings, it never pauses to breathe.
If it is in a battle against an opponent that does not easily
fall asleep, Jigglypuff cannot breathe, endangering its life."
39,40,Wigglytuff,"Wigglytuff’s body is very flexible. By inhaling deeply,
this Pokémon can inflate itself seemingly without end.
Once inflated, Wigglytuff bounces along lightly like a balloon."
40,41,Zubat,"Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become
unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under
the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down."
41,42,Golbat,"Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks
the victim’s blood. It becomes active on inky dark
moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon."
42,43,Oddish,"Oddish searches for fertile, nutrient-rich soil, then plants itself.
During the daytime, while it is planted, this Pokémon’s feet
are thought to change shape and become similar to the roots
of trees."
43,44,Gloom,"From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely
horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench. It sniffs the
noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey."
44,45,Vileplume,"Vileplume has the world’s largest petals. They are used to
attract prey that are then doused with toxic spores. Once the
prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them."
45,46,Paras,"Paras has parasitic mushrooms growing on its back called
tochukaso. They grow large by drawing nutrients from this
Bug Pokémon host. They are highly valued as a medicine
for extending life."
46,47,Parasect,"Parasect is known to infest large trees en masse and drain
nutrients from the lower trunk and roots. When an infested
tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once."
47,48,Venonat,"Venonat is said to have evolved with a coat of thin, stiff hair
that covers its entire body for protection. It possesses large
eyes that never fail to spot even minuscule prey."
48,49,Venomoth,"Venomoth is nocturnal—it is a Pokémon that only becomes
active at night. Its favorite prey are small insects that gather
around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."
49,50,Diglett,"Diglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple—
wherever this Pokémon burrows, the soil is left perfectly tilled
for planting crops. This soil is made ideal for growing
delicious vegetables."
50,51,Dugtrio,"Dugtrio are actually triplets that emerged from one body.
As a result, each triplet thinks exactly like the other two
triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly."
51,52,Meowth,"Meowth withdraws its sharp claws into its paws to slinkily sneak
about without making any incriminating footsteps. For some
reason, this Pokémon loves shiny coins that glitter with light."
52,53,Persian,"Persian has six bold whiskers that give it a look of toughness.
The whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in the
Pokémon’s surrounding vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed
by the whiskers."
53,54,Psyduck,"If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember
having done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such
an event because it goes into an altered state that is much
like deep sleep."
54,55,Golduck,"Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims
effortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It sometimes rescues
people from wrecked ships floundering in high seas."
55,56,Mankey,"When Mankey starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns
rough, it’s a sure sign that it is becoming angry. However,
because it goes into a towering rage almost instantly,
it is impossible for anyone to flee its wrath."
56,57,Primeape,"When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation
is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger.
However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the
same time."
57,58,Growlithe,"Growlithe has a superb sense of smell. Once it smells anything,
this Pokémon won’t forget the scent, no matter what. It uses
its advanced olfactory sense to determine the emotions of
other living things."
58,59,Arcanine,"Arcanine is known for its high speed. It is said to be capable
of running over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The
fire that blazes wildly within this Pokémon’s body is its source
of power."
59,60,Poliwag,"Poliwag has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the
Pokémon’s spiral innards right through the skin. Despite its
thinness, however, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp
fangs bounce right off it."
60,61,Poliwhirl,"The surface of Poliwhirl’s body is always wet and slick with
a slimy fluid. Because of this slippery covering, it can easily
slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle."
61,62,Poliwrath,"Poliwrath’s highly developed, brawny muscles never grow
fatigued, however much it exercises. It is so tirelessly strong,
this Pokémon can swim back and forth across the ocean
without effort."
62,63,Abra,"Abra needs to sleep for eighteen hours a day. If it doesn’t,
this Pokémon loses its ability to use telekinetic powers. If it is
attacked, Abra escapes using Teleport while it is still sleeping."
63,64,Kadabra,"Kadabra holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used
to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the
Pokémon is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its
telekinetic powers."
64,65,Alakazam,"Alakazam’s brain continually grows, infinitely multiplying
brain cells. This amazing brain gives this Pokémon an
astoundingly high IQ of 5,000. It has a thorough memory
of everything that has occurred in the world."
65,66,Machop,"Machop exercises by hefting around a Graveler as if it were
a barbell. There are some Machop that travel the world in a
quest to master all kinds of martial arts."
66,67,Machoke,"Machoke undertakes bodybuilding every day even as
it helps people with tough, physically demanding labor.
On its days off, this Pokémon heads to the fields and
mountains to exercise and train."
67,68,Machamp,"Machamp is known as the Pokémon that has mastered
every kind of martial arts. If it grabs hold of the foe with its
four arms, the battle is all but over. The hapless foe is thrown
far over the horizon."
68,69,Bellsprout,"Bellsprout’s thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway
to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth,
this Pokémon spits a corrosive fluid that melts even iron."
69,70,Weepinbell,"Weepinbell has a large hook on its rear end. At night, the
Pokémon hooks on to a tree branch and goes to sleep.
If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself
on the ground."
70,71,Victreebel,"Victreebel has a long vine that extends from its head.
This vine is waved and flicked about as if it were an animal
to attract prey. When an unsuspecting prey draws near,
this Pokémon swallows it whole."
71,72,Tentacool,"Tentacool absorbs sunlight and refracts it using water inside
its body to convert it into beam energy. This Pokémon shoots
beams from the small round organ above its eyes."
72,73,Tentacruel,"Tentacruel has tentacles that can be freely elongated
and shortened at will. It ensnares prey with its tentacles
and weakens the prey by dosing it with a harsh toxin.
It can catch up to 80 prey at the same time."
73,74,Geodude,"When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the
ground. It will not awaken even if hikers step on it unwittingly.
In the morning, this Pokémon rolls downhill in search of food."
74,75,Graveler,"Rocks are Graveler’s favorite food. This Pokémon will climb a
mountain from the base to the summit, crunchingly feasting on
rocks all the while. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls back down
to the bottom."
75,76,Golem,"Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent
them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves
have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as
guideways for diverting this Pokémon’s course."
76,77,Ponyta,"Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up.
This Pokémon becomes stronger by stumbling and
falling to keep up with its parent."
77,78,Rapidash,"Rapidash usually can be seen casually cantering in the fields
and plains. However, when this Pokémon turns serious, its
fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph."
78,79,Slowpoke,"Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water
at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets
what it’s doing and often spends entire days just loafing
at water’s edge."
79,80,Slowbro,"Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite.
As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This
causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead."
80,81,Magnemite,"Magnemite floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves
from the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This
Pokémon becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical
supply is depleted."
81,82,Magneton,"Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to
electronics and precision instruments. Because of this, it is
said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokémon
inside a Poké Ball."
82,83,Farfetch'd,"Farfetch’d is always seen with a stalk from a plant of some
sort. Apparently, there are good stalks and bad stalks. This
Pokémon has been known to fight with others over stalks."
83,84,Doduo,"Doduo’s two heads contain completely identical brains. A
scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be
examples of this Pokémon possessing different sets of brains."
84,85,Dodrio,"Apparently, the heads aren’t the only parts of the body that
Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as
well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest."
85,86,Seel,"Seel hunts for prey in the frigid sea underneath sheets of ice.
When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice
with the sharply protruding section of its head."
86,87,Dewgong,"Dewgong loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of
this Pokémon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought
to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago."
87,88,Grimer,"Grimer emerged from the sludge that settled on a polluted
seabed. This Pokémon loves anything filthy. It constantly
leaks a horribly germ-infested fluid from all over its body."
88,89,Muk,"This Pokémon’s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly
filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing
away litter on the streets, Muk are certain to gather."
89,90,Shellder,"At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole
in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping,
Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out."
90,91,Cloyster,"Cloyster is capable of swimming in the sea. It does so by
swallowing water, then jetting it out toward the rear. This
Pokémon shoots spikes from its shell using the same system."
91,92,Gastly,"Gastly is largely composed of gaseous matter. When exposed
to a strong wind, the gaseous body quickly dwindles away.
Groups of this Pokémon cluster under the eaves of houses to
escape the ravages of wind."
92,93,Haunter,"Haunter is a dangerous Pokémon. If one beckons you while
floating in darkness, you must never approach it. This Pokémon
will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away."
93,94,Gengar,"Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a
streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you.
It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be
your shadow."
94,95,Onix,"Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that
this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling.
As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder
and smoother."
95,96,Drowzee,"If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it’s a sure
sign that one of these Pokémon is standing above your pillow
and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils."
96,97,Hypno,"Hypno holds a pendulum in its hand. The arcing movement and
glitter of the pendulum lull the foe into a deep state of
hypnosis. While this Pokémon searches for prey, it polishes
the pendulum."
97,98,Krabby,"Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into
the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food,
these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other
over territory."
98,99,Kingler,"Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw. It waves this huge
claw in the air to communicate with others. However, because
the claw is so heavy, the Pokémon quickly tires."
99,100,Voltorb,"Voltorb is extremely sensitive—it explodes at the slightest
of shocks. It is rumored that it was first created when a
Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy."
100,101,Electrode,"One of Electrode’s characteristics is its attraction to electricity.
It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at
electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just
been generated."
101,102,Exeggcute,"This Pokémon consists of six eggs that form a closely knit
cluster. The six eggs attract each other and spin around.
When cracks increasingly appear on the eggs, Exeggcute is
close to evolution."
102,103,Exeggutor,"Exeggutor originally came from the tropics. Its heads
steadily grow larger from exposure to strong sunlight. It is
said that when the heads fall off, they group together to
form Exeggcute."
103,104,Cubone,"Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a
likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on
the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds."
104,105,Marowak,"Marowak is the evolved form of a Cubone that has overcome
its sadness at the loss of its mother and grown tough. This
Pokémon’s tempered and hardened spirit is not easily broken."
105,106,Hitmonlee,"Hitmonlee’s legs freely contract and stretch. Using these
springlike legs, it bowls over foes with devastating kicks.
After battle, it rubs down its legs and loosens the muscles
to overcome fatigue."
106,107,Hitmonchan,"Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had
been working toward a world championship. This Pokémon
has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face
of adversity."
107,108,Lickitung,"Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will
unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things
by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things."
108,109,Koffing,"Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw
garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas
is concocted by this Pokémon."
109,110,Weezing,"Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed,
the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also
becomes more putrid."
110,111,Rhyhorn,"Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run
it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently
remembers sometimes if it demolishes something."
111,112,Rhydon,"Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for
destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokémon occasionally
rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents
it from feeling the heat."
112,113,Chansey,"Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis.
The eggs are so delicious, they are easily and eagerly
devoured by even those people who have lost their appetite."
113,114,Tangela,"Tangela’s vines snap off easily if they are grabbed. This
happens without pain, allowing it to make a quick getaway.
The lost vines are replaced by newly grown vines the very
next day."
114,115,Kangaskhan,"If you come across a young Kangaskhan playing by itself,
you must never disturb it or attempt to catch it. The baby
Pokémon’s parent is sure to be in the area, and it will
become violently enraged at you."
115,116,Horsea,"If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense
black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pokémon
swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back."
116,117,Seadra,"Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body.
The whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even
fishing boats. This Pokémon weakens prey with
these currents, then swallows it whole."
117,118,Goldeen,"Goldeen loves swimming wild and free in rivers and ponds.
If one of these Pokémon is placed in an aquarium, it will
shatter even the thickest glass with one ram of its horn
and make its escape."
118,119,Seaking,"Seaking is very protective of its eggs. The male and female
will take turns patrolling around their nest and eggs. The
guarding of eggs by these Pokémon goes on for over a month."
119,120,Staryu,"Staryu apparently communicates with the stars in the night sky
by flashing the red core at the center of its body. If parts of its
body are torn, this Pokémon simply regenerates the missing
pieces and limbs."
120,121,Starmie,"Starmie swims through water by spinning its star-shaped
body as if it were a propeller on a ship. The core at the
center of this Pokémon’s body glows in seven colors."
121,122,Mr. Mime,"Mr. Mime is a master of pantomime. Its gestures and motions
convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists.
Once the watchers are convinced, the unseeable thing exists
as if it were real."
122,123,Scyther,"Scyther is blindingly fast. Its blazing speed enhances the
effectiveness of the twin scythes on its forearms. This
Pokémon’s scythes are so effective, they can slice through
thick logs in one wicked stroke."
123,124,Jynx,"Jynx walks rhythmically, swaying and shaking its hips
as if it were dancing. Its motions are so bouncingly alluring,
people seeing it are compelled to shake their hips without
giving any thought to what they are doing."
124,125,Electabuzz,"When a storm arrives, gangs of this Pokémon compete with
each other to scale heights that are likely to be stricken by
lightning bolts. Some towns use Electabuzz in place of
lightning rods."
125,126,Magmar,"In battle, Magmar blows out intensely hot flames from
all over its body to intimidate its opponent. This Pokémon’s
fiery bursts create heat waves that ignite grass and trees in
its surroundings."
126,127,Pinsir,"Pinsir has a pair of massive horns. Protruding from the surface
of these horns are thorns. These thorns are driven deeply into
the foe’s body when the pincer closes, making it tough for the
foe to escape."
127,128,Tauros,"This Pokémon is not satisfied unless it is rampaging at all
times. If there is no opponent for Tauros to battle, it will
charge at thick trees and knock them down to calm itself."
128,129,Magikarp,"Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash
around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However,
it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any
body of water no matter how polluted it is."
129,130,Gyarados,"Once Gyarados goes on a rampage, its ferociously violent
blood doesn’t calm until it has burned everything down.
There are records of this Pokémon’s rampages lasting a
whole month."
130,131,Lapras,"People have driven Lapras almost to the point of extinction.
In the evenings, this Pokémon is said to sing plaintively as
it seeks what few others of its kind still remain."
131,132,Ditto,"Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other
shapes. However, if it tries to transform itself into something
by relying on its memory, this Pokémon manages to get
details wrong."
132,133,Eevee,"Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates
due to the environment in which it lives. Radiation from various
stones causes this Pokémon to evolve."
133,134,Vaporeon,"Vaporeon underwent a spontaneous mutation and grew fins
and gills that allow it to live underwater. This Pokémon has
the ability to freely control water."
134,135,Jolteon,"Jolteon’s cells generate a low level of electricity. This power
is amplified by the static electricity of its fur, enabling the
Pokémon to drop thunderbolts. The bristling fur is made of
electrically charged needles."
135,136,Flareon,"Flareon’s fluffy fur has a functional purpose—it releases heat
into the air so that its body does not get excessively hot.
This Pokémon’s body temperature can rise to a maximum of
1,650 degrees Fahrenheit."
136,137,Porygon,"Porygon is capable of reverting itself entirely back to program
data and entering cyberspace. This Pokémon is copy protected
so it cannot be duplicated by copying."
137,138,Omanyte,"Omanyte is one of the ancient and long-since-extinct Pokémon
that have been regenerated from fossils by people. If attacked
by an enemy, it withdraws itself inside its hard shell."
138,139,Omastar,"Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is
believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too
large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow
and ponderous."
139,140,Kabuto,"Kabuto is a Pokémon that has been regenerated from a fossil.
However, in extremely rare cases, living examples have
been discovered. The Pokémon has not changed at all for
300 million years."
140,141,Kabutops,"Kabutops swam underwater to hunt for its prey in ancient
times. The Pokémon was apparently evolving from being a
water dweller to living on land as evident from the beginnings
of change in its gills and legs."

Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will,
so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people."

powerful. While the Pokémon may think it is just playfully
nipping, its bite has enough power to cause serious injury."

to remove when they have sunk in."

earth’s rotation. Using this special organ, this Pokémon
begins hooting at precisely the same time every day."

in flight."

body. This fluid is used for communicating with others.

its energy."

to send signals back and forth with others far away."

balloons if it spots a drowning Pokémon. The air balloons
enable the Pokémon in trouble to breathe."

green throughout the year, the Pokémon is easily identified
as a fake during the winter."

foreign lands. The Pokémon descends to the ground when it
encounters cold air while it is floating."

manipulated. However, because the Pokémon uses its tail so
much, its real hands have become rather clumsy."

because it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its
body for its evolution. It will not eat a thing, subsisting only on
morning dew."

actively in the daytime when it is warm. It stops moving as

Destiny Bond."

thinking. However, the rear head doesn’t need to sleep, so it

The shell is opened when the Pokémon is catching prey,

convenient for collecting pollen from flowers. This Pokémon

really horns that have been transformed."

tire could easily fit inside this Pokémon’s mouth."

at the intruder with its pointed fangs. On its own, however, this
Pokémon turns suddenly timid."

seawater out of its backside. This Pokémon’s drawback is its
inability to swim long distances."

up with more water, this Pokémon can elevate the height of
its bounces."

water and making a humongous splash. It is breathtaking to
see this Pokémon leaping out of the sea with others in its pod."

of its bones. They sometimes blast out molten magma.

desert and waits for its prey to come tumbling down. This

growing. Rather than flying long distances, they are more
useful for generating ultrasonic waves by vibrating."

“singing” is the only thing that can be heard in a sandstorm,

fragrant a flower Cacnea grows. This Pokémon battles by
wildly swinging its thorny arms."
